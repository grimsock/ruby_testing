### Ruby testing exercises

1. clone this repo
2. go to local repo directory and install bundler `gem install bundler`
3. install dependencies `bundle install`
4. to run example tests do `rspec spec/example_spec.rb` - pass `--color` for nicer output
5. add as many as possible new tests. Don't forget about covering negative paths, meaningful description if needed and
   try to not break one test - one assertion (expectation) rule. If reasonable try to use test doubles.
6. commit them and push repo to your github account
